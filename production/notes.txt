Use of the website: I'm a big fan of Adafruit for sourcing hardware materials for my physical computation projects. Their website has become my go-to destination for sensors, microcontrollers, or other components. I also appreciate that they're a New York-based, women-owned company, because it might motivate more women to enter the tech/engineering field.
